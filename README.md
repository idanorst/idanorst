- 👋 Hi, I’m @idanorst
- 👀 I’m a really sports freak and also quite interested in nature, so my biggest dream is to combine these interest with programming in some way. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different parts of frontend-development, and have been through different online courses in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and are currently focusing on React.
- 🎄 Check out my Adventskalender (only in Norwegian 😐) at https://spectacular-malabi-3d8c56.netlify.app/
